{"name":"Kthartechnomagic","tagline":"A Minecraft mod of technological magic.","body":"KtharTechnoMagic\r\n================\r\n\r\n## A Minecraft mod of technological magic.\r\n\r\nK'thar Magic was an ancient form of drawing upon the powers of the world. Casting of this magic was called shaping, and while most people were born with the seed within them, few were able to develop this into an ability they could control and use.\r\n\r\nThe magic power used to shape feats of magic is drawn from Wells of Essence. There are four wells: Mind, Celestials, World and End. Each of these have their core elements that are used while shaping.\r\n\r\n* Well of the Mind:\r\n  * Life <-> Death\r\n  * Body <-> Soul\r\n* Well of the Celestials\r\n  * Light <-> Dark\r\n  * Heat <-> Cold\r\n* Well of the World\r\n  * Water <-> Fire\r\n  * Earth <-> Wind\r\n* Well of the End\r\n  * Stasis <-> Motion\r\n\r\nLittle remains of the old art, and now few are able to pull and shape essence without the aid of various objects as focus. Machine blueprints were created to ease the access to the four wells, and have become a requirement to be able to access the magic power.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Henrik 'Tivec' Bergvin\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
