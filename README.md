KtharTechnoMagic
================

## A Minecraft mod of technological magic.

K'thar Magic was an ancient form of drawing upon the powers of the world. Casting of this magic was called shaping, and
while most people were born with the seed within them, few were able to develop this into an ability they could control
and use.

The magic power used to shape feats of magic is drawn from Wells of Essence. There are four wells: Mind, Celestials,
World and End. Each of these have their core elements that are used while shaping.

Well of the Mind:
	Life <-> Death
	Body <-> Soul

Well of the Celestials
	Light <-> Dark
	Heat <-> Cold

Well of the World
	Water <-> Fire
	Earth <-> Wind

Well of the End
	Stasis <-> Motion

Little remains of the old art, and now few are able to pull and shape essence without the aid of various objects as
focus. Machine blueprints were created to ease the access to the four wells, and have become a requirement to be able to
access the magic power.
