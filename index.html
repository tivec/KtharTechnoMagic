        <p>K'thar Magic was an ancient form of drawing upon the powers of the world. Casting of this magic was called shaping, and while most people were born with the seed within them, few were able to develop this into an ability they could control and use.</p>

<p>The magic power used to shape feats of magic is drawn from Wells of Essence. There are four wells: Mind, Celestials, World and End. Each of these have their core elements that are used while shaping.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well of the Mind:

<ul>
<li>Life &lt;-&gt; Death</li>
<li>Body &lt;-&gt; Soul</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well of the Celestials

<ul>
<li>Light &lt;-&gt; Dark</li>
<li>Heat &lt;-&gt; Cold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well of the World

<ul>
<li>Water &lt;-&gt; Fire</li>
<li>Earth &lt;-&gt; Wind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well of the End

<ul>
<li>Stasis &lt;-&gt; Motion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>Little remains of the old art, and now few are able to pull and shape essence without the aid of various objects as focus. Machine blueprints were created to ease the access to the four wells, and have become a requirement to be able to access the magic power.</p>
